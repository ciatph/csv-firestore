## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, we encourage you to let the Maintainer know right away.

They will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem.

Email `ciatph.dev@gmail.com` to disclose any security vulnerabilities.

You should receive a response within 3 business days. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure they received your original message.

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

- Type of issue (e.g. SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help the Maintainer triage your report more quickly.
